Off the beaten path, but definitely well-established. Lots of people from the clergy, clerics, paladins, etc.

[[Anthar Fruum]] is at the bar and is distrusting of us. Need to win him over before he'll tell us where we can find Leosin.
Eventually end up taking part in the fighting pit.

Human male teenager ([[Anthar Fruum]]'s squire) knocks during the night and has us follow him 

We tell [[Anthar Fruum]] and [[Leosin]] and a few others about what happened at the Dragon Hatchery. 

Organizations:
- [[The Harpers]]
- [[The Order of the Gauntlet]]
- [[Emerald Enclave]]

We've been charged with sailing down the river towards Baldur's Gate
