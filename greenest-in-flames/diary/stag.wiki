Is elven prince. Cursed by father of the woman he loved. Whenever he leaves the walls, he turns into the stag.

No longer remembers his name. 

== Quests ==
 - [X] A wizard may exist that may be able to lift the curse.
   - [X] Purchase a potion from Potion Seller to cure hex

I have a list of items needed. Potion Seller mentions that the list of items is expensive.

Managed to raise the funds and buy the potion.

Hands me a phoenix idol with a blue and yellow glow.
