<p>
There's a <a href="Tim the Wise.html">Tim the Wise</a> and <a href="drow.html">drow</a> performing some kind of ceremony on a supine human woman.
They're performing a ritual for the <a href="Spider Queen.html">Spider Queen</a>. Very clearly trying to sacrifice the human female
</p>

<p>
The slaves <a href="Tim the Wise.html">Tim the Wise</a> was told to rescue were brought as a sacrifice supply.
</p>

<p>
Bombaata hits <a href="Tim the Wise.html">Tim the Wise</a> and he turns into a dragon!
</p>

<p>
<a href="Ungrim Reborn.html">Ungrim Reborn</a> mounts the dragon and makes it flee, vowing to not let us escape.
</p>

<p>
A group of lizard people come in, bring in a troll. They tell us we're near their sacred ponds and ask us to come in with them.
We kill them.
</p>

<p>
A new set of lizard people come by, draw us out and lead us through the halls to a Shaman. We took a dip in their sacred pool and gained a long rest.
</p>

<p>
Fighting pit marshalled by pirates. Take cargo (slaves) from <a href="Tim the Wise.html">Tim the Wise</a> and sell whenever possible. Not familiar with the Crown Guard.
</p>

<p>
Found a chest and immediately fumbled the bag. One pirate lost an arm in the bag of devouring. Chest is magically locked. 
</p>

<p>
Chest is buried in the marsh to the north. We entered the caves again and have surrendered ourselves after getting perforated by a bunch of pistols.
</p>

<p>
Woke up and told the pirate captain we were sent by the Crown Guard. Brass dragon (maybe Tim the Wise) starts flying and attacking the pirate ship.
</p>

<p>
Dragon flew away and now we're part of the captain's crew.
