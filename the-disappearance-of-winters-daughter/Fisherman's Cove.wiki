== Notes: ==

There's a [[Tim the Wise]] and [[drow]] performing some kind of ceremony on a supine human woman.
They're performing a ritual for the [[Spider Queen]]. Very clearly trying to sacrifice the human female

The slaves [[Tim the Wise]] was told to rescue were brought as a sacrifice supply.

Bombaata hits [[Tim the Wise]] and he turns into a dragon!

[[Ungrim Reborn]] mounts the dragon and makes it flee, vowing to not let us escape.

A group of lizard people come in, bring in a troll. They tell us we're near their sacred ponds and ask us to come in with them.
We kill them.

A new set of lizard people come by, draw us out and lead us through the halls to a Shaman. We took a dip in their sacred pool and gained a long rest.

Fighting pit marshalled by pirates. Take cargo (slaves) from [[Tim the Wise]] and sell whenever possible. Not familiar with the Crown Guard.

Found a chest and immediately fumbled the bag. One pirate lost an arm in the bag of devouring. Chest is magically locked. 

Chest is buried in the marsh to the north. We entered the caves again and have surrendered ourselves after getting perforated by a bunch of pistols.

Woke up and told the pirate captain we were sent by the Crown Guard. Brass dragon (maybe Tim the Wise) starts flying and attacking the pirate ship.

Dragon flew away and now we're part of the captain's crew.
