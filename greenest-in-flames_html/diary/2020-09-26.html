<p>
A few days have passed. Only <a href="Bog Luck.html">Bog Luck</a>'s door has a lock.
</p>

<p>
Party is split between laborers and guards. Laborers are busy building the road. Guards are just guarding them.
</p>

<p>
Bog Luck keeps a very strict ledger on what gets placed in the storage room.
</p>

<p>
As Archie wittles through the ceiling, he can hear the cultists say the following:
&gt; Strong room, tunnel, lizard folk, Bog Luck
</p>

<p>
<a href="Grisseled Pete.html">Grisseled Pete</a> sleeps in the kitchen and talks in his sleep about "don't get no sleep from all those critters in the floors".
</p>

<p>
SaladTosser and Didrik head into the warehouse room and unlock the strong room. SaladTosser opens the door and sees lizard folk in the room behind a barrel.
</p>

<p>
SaladTosser creates a distraction and draws out Bog Luck and Larry Keenblade to investigate. Bog Luck heads to the warehouse on his own.
</p>

<p>
<a href="Bog Luck.html">Bog Luck</a> sees the door to the strong room open and just closes it. Suspiciously tells Larry Keenblade to head back to his room.
</p>

<p>
<a href="Bog Luck.html">Bog Luck</a> mutters in his sleep annoyed at the lizard men. Seemingly on the take.
</p>

<p>
<a href="../SaladTosser.html">SaladTosser</a> manages to get <a href="Bog Luck.html">Bog Luck</a> to head back to the strong room. She tries to follow him, but she's not stealthy enough and gets caught. Larry Keenblade slaps some monocles on her and has <a href="../Jozor.html">Jozor</a> watch her all night.
</p>

<p>
<a href="Bog Luck.html">Bog Luck</a> wakes everyone up and makes an example of her. Notices her manacles are already unlocked. Unconvinced by <a href="../Jozor.html">Jozor</a>'s reason, he gets beaten as well.
</p>

<p>
At dinner, one of the cultists yells about the party killing one of their own. Jozor and the cultist begin fighting on the first floor.
</p>

<p>
Archie walks out and Jozor gets fucking bodied.
