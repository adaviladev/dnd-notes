Infiltrate Cultist caravans

</ul>

<p>
<a href="../Didrik.html">Didrik</a>, <a href="../SaladTosser.html">SaladTosser</a> and <a href="../Grot.html">Grot</a> somehow burnt down a merchant's caravan and killed three and a horse?
</p>

<p>
<a href="Lai Angesstun.html">Lai Angesstun</a> overseeing the murder is last seen entering a <a href="../Cult of the Dragon.html">cultist's</a> wagon.
</p>

<p>
There's some celestial <a href="stag.html">stag</a> in the distance. <a href="../Didrik.html">Didrik</a> is trying to hunt. <a href="../Archie.html">Archie</a> is trying to save the deer.
</p>

<p>
Archie saves the <a href="stag.html">stag</a> and rides him back to the caravan.
</p>

<p>
Ten days pass and as we near the next town, we see a head on the ground. The words "Oath Breaker" are written on his forehead.
Carlin was buried here. 
  Lie: He broke a promise to marry a woman. Her family is composed of bandits. He left her at the altar. (Grot suspects he's lying [19 insight])
</p>

<p>
<a href="Carlon.html">Carlon Amoffel</a> is a member of <a href="../The Harpers.html">The Harpers</a>. The caravan continues while Archie and Grot circle back.
</p>
  
<p>
Ten more days and we reach <a href="Dragon's Spear.html">Dragon's Spear</a>
</p>

<p>
A <a href="Azbara Jos.html">human</a> male with a red hood and a female gnome. 
</p>

<p>
One of the travelers that's joined since Baldur's Gate seems to recognize <a href="Grot.html">Grot</a> from the first raid in session 1. <a href="../SaladTosser.html">SaladTosser</a> hands him a beer that <a href="../Archie.html">Archie</a> poisoned with mushrooms. <a href="../Jozor.html">Jozor</a> and <a href="../Didrik.html">Didrik</a> manage to ambush him a few yards away and kill him outright.
</p>

<p>
<a href="Jamna.html">Jamna Gleamsilver</a> is seemingly showing interest in the human male. Human has been seen entering the cultists' wagons. 
</p>

<p>
Approaches <a href="../Didrik.html">Didrik</a> and fishes out a sliver of bone in his oatmeal and is also likely in all of the party's bowls. <a href="../Didrik.html">Didrik</a>'s suspicion is pretty strong that <a href="Jamna.html">Jamna</a> did this to ingratiate herself with the party.
</p>

<p>
<a href="Jamna.html">Jamna</a> needs a distraction so she can investigate the cultists' wagons to see what they're transporting.
</p>

<p>
The party throws a party as a distraction for <a href="Jamna.html">Jamna</a> to sneak into the different wagons. After about five minutes of sneaking through the wagons and opening different crates et al, she wanders back to her wagon and "pretends" to sleep.
